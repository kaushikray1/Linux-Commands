First create app.desktop file on Desktop (Name of the application)

In the Terminal type (if you dont have Gedit type "sudo apt-get install gedit"
 
    gedit ~/Desktop/arduino.desktoperminal 

You can name that file what ever you want, because the launcherâ€™s name has nothing to do with its file name.
Copy and paste the following lines in to the files

    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Arduino
    Comment=Launcher for app
    Exec=<path for the app>
    Icon=<path for the app>/logo.png
    Categories=Application;Development;IDE;
    Version=1.0
    Type=Application
    Terminal=true

Just change the YOUR_NAME to your username. Save and close the file.
Now we have to make that file executable.
    
Open the terminal and execute the following command.

    chmod +x ~/Desktop/arduino.desktop
